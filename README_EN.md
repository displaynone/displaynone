### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone, I'm Luis SacristÃ¡n, a full-stack web developer specializing in WordPress and Node applications, though I also dabble in mobile using Expo.

I'm currently working at [OnTheGoSystems](https://onthegosystems.com/team/luis-sacristan/), the company behind [WPML](https://wpml.org), although I have also worked for the [Toolset](https://toolset.com) plugin, the Adelance App, and currently for PTC and ATE.

Among my personal projects, I'd like to highlight:

- [Shield Authenticator](https://github.com/displaynone/shield-authenticator): an open-source alternative to Google Authenticator.
- [TapoNFC](https://github.com/displaynone/taponfc): allows to enable/disable Tapo cameras using NFC tags
- [Podcast It](https://github.com/displaynone/podcast-it): converts a YouTube link to listen to it as a podcast.
- [Nautilus Movie Thumbnailer](https://github.com/displaynone/nautilus-movie-thumbnailer): a small utility for Nautilus that displays the movies I have stored with captures from IMDB.
- [Baja YT](https://github.com/displaynone/bajayt): an app that allows you to download YouTube videos (video or audio only).
- [checkweb](https://github.com/displaynone/checkweb): checks if a website is online and, in that case, sends a Telegram message.
- [cuentas](https://github.com/displaynone/cuentas/): a full-stack app (backend + frontend) to keep track of your bank account with precision.
